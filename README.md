# My Python Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey**! This repository is a log of my progression from complete beginner to intermediate Python programmer, as I explore, experiment, and build with Python. The goal of this repo is to track my growth, share resources, and document the skills Iâ€™ve learned.

---

## Why Python? ðŸ¤”
I chose Python because itâ€™s one of the most beginner-friendly languages, yet itâ€™s powerful enough for professionals in fields like data science, web development, and automation. Python's simplicity and readability make it the perfect first language for anyone looking to start their programming journey.

## My Learning Path ðŸ“š

Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™ve broken down my Python journey:

### 1. **Starting with the Basics** ðŸ“–
In this section, I focused on the absolute fundamentals:
- **Variables and Data Types**: Understanding numbers, strings, lists, and booleans.
- **Basic Operations**: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.
- **Control Flow**: Learning about `if`, `else`, and `elif` to make decisions in code.
- **Loops**: Repeating tasks with `for` and `while` loops.

> **Key Milestone**: My first program was a simple "Hello, World!" script that introduced me to Pythonâ€™s syntax and how to run code.

### 2. **Building Blocks: Functions & Data Structures** ðŸ”¨
Once I grasped the basics, I moved on to more complex concepts:
- **Functions**: Creating reusable blocks of code.
- **Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries**: Handling collections of data.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.

> **Key Milestone**: I built a text-based To-Do list app, which helped me understand how functions, lists, and loops work together.

### 3. **Diving Deeper: OOP and Error Handling** ðŸŒŠ
Next, I began exploring Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and error handling to write more robust code:
- **Classes & Objects**: Understanding objects, methods, and attributes.
- **Exception Handling**: Catching errors using `try`, `except`.

> **Key Milestone**: I created my first simple class for managing a list of books, learning how to interact with objects.

### 4. **Exploring Advanced Topics** ðŸŒŸ
At this point, I ventured into more specialized areas of Python:
- **Web Scraping**: Using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` to collect data from websites.
- **APIs**: Learning how to make requests and work with data from public APIs.
- **Data Science Basics**: Working with libraries like `Pandas` and `NumPy` for basic data manipulation.

> **Key Milestone**: I built a small web scraper to collect weather data from a public API.
